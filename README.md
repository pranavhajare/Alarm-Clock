# Alarm-Clock Web App
An interactive web-based alarm clock created using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. This simple project allows users to set alarms, view their active alarms, and receive alerts when an alarm goes off.

## Features

- **Clock Face:** Displays the current time in 12-hour format with hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM.
  
- **Analog Clock:** Displays the current time in an Analog Clock.

- **Set Alarm:** Provides input fields to set an alarm time (hour, minute, second, AM/PM). Ensures input validation to prevent setting alarms without all required information.

- **Alarms List:** Lists all user-set alarms, each with a "Delete" button to remove the alarm without triggering it.

- **Alert Functionality:** When an alarm time matches the current time, the app triggers a browser alert to notify the user.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. Set alarms by specifying the hour, minute, second, and AM/PM, and click the "Set Alarm" button.

4. View and manage your alarms in the "Alarms List" section.
